The Bioforce team is delighted to present its 2024 short courses: almost 70 sessions, in 9 countries and by distance learning! 67 short training sessions in Europe, Africa and by distance learning 67 sessions are open for registration this year in Europe, Africa and at a distance, in fields as varied as project management, human resources, finance, logistics and security, as well as sessions to discover the humanitarian sector and how it works, or to work on your plans to move into a career in solidarity. In Europe, we are offering shorter face-to-face formats (3 days) that are more compatible with your professional activities, and new locations (Brussels and Geneva in addition to Paris). Also on the programme are sessions dedicated to current or future players in national solidarity or emergency social aid in our territories: mobilising and supporting a team of volunteers, working in partnership to implement a solidarity project, etc. In Africa, we are continuing to work as closely as possible with those involved in crisis response, offering training courses in six different countries (Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chad). And there are always evening courses at our training centre in Dakar, with safety on the agenda… To find out more about the full range of short courses on offer for 2024, download the “Europe and distance learning” and “Africa and distance learning” calendars by clicking on the links below.
