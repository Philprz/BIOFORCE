The impact of the assistance you provide to \npopulations is therefore determined by the level of skills among your teams. Every day we \ndraw on our exper/t.caltise and work hard to develop and maintain these skills at the level you \nrequire for your work.\nOur organisation develops ef/f.caltective tools to suppor/t.calt your human resources policies and \nyour operational strategy. Together, we transform your capacity building requirements into \ntraining programmes for your teams, your organisation and your national par/t.caltners.\nOur learning solutions, as ready-made or bespoke packages, always put practice and \nmeaning at the hear/t.calt of the learning process. They constantly evolve in line with the \nhumanitarian contex/t.calt in order to of/f.calter you the most suitable tools and ensure the \noperational level you expect.\nOur training tools are designed by and for people working in the humanitarian sector. \nCalling on our teams to help co-build training oppor/t.caltunities is a way of addressing your \nneeds, cer/t.caltainly, but it also of/f.calters you a means of contributing towards the development \nof new learning programmes which can later be used by the whole of the sector.  \nTogether, we can put capacity building at the hear/t.calt of the humanitarian sector's \ndevelopment; together we can show that it is fundamental to meeting the needs of \nvulnerable populations.\nGilles Collard\nManaging Director\nAt the hear/t.calt of your operational strategies invariably lie your teams.

To of/f.calter more ef/f.caltective disaster response in this \npar/t.calt of the world. Inès Ladraa, Training Of/f.calticer, shares her \nexperience of working with Bioforce: \"The plat/f.caltorm is \nnot a training provider. Our core work revolves around \ndisaster response. But we also work on capacity \nbuilding with the local teams, and for that we clearly \nneed to work with a training provider which has \nalready earned its stripes. What we par/t.calticularly like \nwith Bioforce is the suppor/t.calt and follow-up before, \nduring and af/t.calter the programme.

This is the need expressed by Caritas \nFrance for its Malian network. We dispatched two consul/t.caltants \nfor a 10-day assignment: following an initial phase spent \npreparing the assessment tools and collecting the data, they \nvisited the National Secretariat in Bamako as well as each \ndiocese in Mali. There they met with the teams to try to gain a \nbet/t.calter understanding of their logistics, ﬁnance and human \nresources work, practices and procedures. They were able to \nanalyse the gaps, identify any areas for improvement and \nsuggest recommendations and an action plan for change \n(updating procedures, training and suppor/t.calt).\nWe have really established\na relationship based on trust.\nFOR WHOM\nPARTNERS  \nTOPICS\nLOGISTICS\nMANAGEMENT\nFINANCE MANAGEMENT\nFOR WHOM\nPARTNERS\nTOPICS\nLOGISTICS\nWe have really established\na relationship based on trust.\nWe have really established\na relationship based on trust.\nWe have really established\na relationship based on trust.\nWe have really established\na relationship based on trust.\nOCHA/Eve Sabbagh\nAjay Paul,\nEmergency Response Director, Wel/t.calthungerhil/f.calte\nTraining in 5 dif/f.calterent countries\nThe West and Central Africa Regional Of/f.caltice for the UN \nWorld Food Programme called upon Bioforce to provide \ncapacity building for its national par/t.caltners. Our team worked \nto develop and deliver a training programme on emergency \npreparedness logistics in ﬁve dif/f.calterent countries: Central \nAfrican Republic, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger. \nFollow-up meetings were then organised to help the teams \ntrained to implement the individual action plan they had \nestablished during the course. \nThanks to this suppor/t.calt over three months, 98 humanitarian \nprofessionals are now more ef/f.calticient in emergency supply \nchain management.\nThe training was provided by an experienced Bioforce \ntrainer with very good understanding of complex \ncontex/t.calts,\nbut who, at the same time, was able to deliver a training that allowed par/t.calticipation from staf/f.calt \nwho never had security training before to those with ex/t.caltensive experience of working in \ninsecure and hostile environments.The sessions were well structured with a good mix of \ntheory, controlled practice and role play.
