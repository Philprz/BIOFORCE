According to the new European Qualifications Framework, these certifications equate to levels 7, 6 and 5 (equivalent to a 5, 4 and 2-year high education diploma). They can be accessed through Accreditation of Prior Learning. What difference does it make to be registered in this Directory? In order to adapt to changes in the humanitarian sector, Bioforce conducts job surveys every 2-3 years with humanitarian organisations (skills required to carry out each profession for which we provide training). These skills are listed in a reference document, used to design the content of courses. This document is sent to the French National Commission for Professional Qualifications. Approval by this Commission and registration at the French National Directory of Professional Qualifications, marks the state’s recognition as well as its suitability to the job market.
