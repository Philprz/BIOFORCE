Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) at Bioforce Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) is an opportunity for people to gain recognition for their experience (professional or otherwise) in order to obtain a diploma. It is therefore obtained through experience (rather than by means of formal education or lifelong learning) and based on aspects other than a final examination. Please note that APL at Bioforce is not available in English. Admission criteria At least one year in post, whether in a single period or broken up, directly related to the target qualification. All paid and unpaid work is taken into consideration for APL applications (volunteering, internships, placements, etc.) whether in France or abroad. A Level 1 Civic safety and prevention certificate (first aid certificate or equivalent). The APL process can be started in advance of the course, but it must be completed in advance of the viva before the panel.
