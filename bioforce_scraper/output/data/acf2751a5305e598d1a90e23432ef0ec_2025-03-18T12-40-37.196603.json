Together, we transform your capacity building requirements into training programmes for your teams, your organisation and your national partners. We can design your bespoke solutions together Whether tailored courses based on our existing content or bespoke courses designed just for you, what really matters is to make sure that what we do together meets your requirements. Tell us your requirements If you don’t have the time to give us an in-depth account of your needs, we can also help you with this. We set up a purpose-built team a project officer, a technical adviser, a trainer/facilitator Together, you fine tune the requirement Understanding your issues better in order to re-assess the requirements and establish the target audience (headquarters, field, international or national teams, partners). We establish together a project to suit your requirements: we adapt existing courses or create new content. We establish together post-training support: we help each participant put the skills they have learnt into practice and assess the impact of the solution on your teams. Select The place and time, the language, the format (on-site, online through our learning platform or a blended-approach). Organisational assessment Whether to increase your impact or to start taking new issues into consideration, an organisational assessment is the starting point to improve your practices throughout the organisation or simply within a specific project in the field. During an organisational assessment, your capacities, as well as your implementing partners’, can be assessed. What can be improved is identified, and your assets pinpointed. Each assessment results in recommendations regarding the development of capacity building tools or actions. At Bioforce, organisational assessments are completed by experts that are selected according to your context and the objectives which you previously established with our team. They can relate to specific aspects of your organisation or work in the field (financial management, safety and security, or logistics for example), or to your organisation in general. Request for a quote The Red Cross platform in the Indian Ocean is not a training provider. Our core work revolves around disaster response. But we also work on capacity building with the local teams, and for that we clearly need to work with a training provider which has already earned its stripes. What we particularly like with Bioforce is the support and follow-up before, during and after the programme. We have really established a relationship based on trust.
