These difficulties directly impact the efficiency of their programmes. Over recent years there has been increased attention given by humanitarian and development agencies to the quality of humanitarian and development practice and raised awareness of the importance of ensuring programme quality in the sector. Bioforce has been actively involved in these developments through extensive consultations on the challenges faced by NGOs. Developing their ability to hire, develop and retain competent managers has been recognised as a top priority. Both humanitarian and development organisations as well as individuals expressed the need for training programmes that enable potential and current managers to develop their technical, analytical and personal skills.
