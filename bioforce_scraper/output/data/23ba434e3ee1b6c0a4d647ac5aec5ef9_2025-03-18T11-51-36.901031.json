Bertrand Quinet Head Bioforce Regional Training Centre Europe Making it easier to meet the humanitarian community Over 30 international aid organisations are here to meet you every year at Bioforce, in Lyon and in Dakar, during the humanitarian forum, to talk to you and get to know you better before you finish your training. It is very important for us to take part in this forum, not only to ensure that trainees are aware of Oxfam and what we do across the world, but also, working with Bioforce enables us to have access to people who are trained, who understand humanitarian work and who can be operational in the countries where we work quickly.

It offers an opportunity to see the development in the profiles of people training at Bioforce, to present our organisation and what we do, and to talk to students.
