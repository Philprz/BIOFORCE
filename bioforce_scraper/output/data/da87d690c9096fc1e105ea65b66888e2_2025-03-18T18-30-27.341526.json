Almost 700 students complete internships or “skills assessment and application placements” across the globe in addition to their training in the centres. After training in the centre, continue learning while on assignment in the field This a fundamental element of Bioforce’s teaching approach which combines the acquisition and application of skills. Our diploma courses include professional experience with a humanitarian experience in the field lasting 4 to 6 months (depending on the training course). Our teaching teams guide and help students in their planned assignments and help to prepare them to meet future employers. They are supported by the training programme coordinator throughout their assignment. The graduation is subject to an evaluation from the employer and submission of the assignment report. The panel awarding graduation is made up of representatives from Bioforce, but also from the professional sector (NGO employees, employers). In 2019, 163 students graduated. Throughout the world Nearly 450 students are on assignment worldwide to complete their trainig. After learning in the centre, continue learning while on assignment in the field. “Roving personel” : humanitarians ready to be deployed at anytime for short missions in any country. Main employers of our students in 2021 Personal stories The Bioforce training also kept me going; I know that I couldn’t have completed my assignment if I hadn’t first done my training at Bioforce. There were times when I felt stressed about all my responsibilities and if I hadn’t done the training I might have quit. When I was unsure about anything, I often went over the difficult situations we tackled in practical simulations or in class. Serge Logistics Manager, Irak, Médecins Sans Frontières Switzerland Alumni, trained as Logistician After several assignments, the courses and course materials still provide a source of information and I often refer to them in the field to validate certain technical choices or even to develop some training. Baptiste Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Projects Manager, Iraq, Solidarités International Alumni, trained as Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Projects Manager Bioforce offers many tools, a very good knowledge of the environment and the donors, a sound approach to the challenges and a very solid network. It means that we are well ahead.
