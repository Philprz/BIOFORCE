We establish together a project to suit your requirements: we adapt existing courses or create new content.

Select The place and time, the language, the format (on-site, online through our learning platform or a blended-approach). Organisational assessment Whether to increase your impact or to start taking new issues into consideration, an organisational assessment is the starting point to improve your practices throughout the organisation or simply within a specific project in the field. During an organisational assessment, your capacities, as well as your implementing partners’, can be assessed. What can be improved is identified, and your assets pinpointed. Each assessment results in recommendations regarding the development of capacity building tools or actions. At Bioforce, organisational assessments are completed by experts that are selected according to your context and the objectives which you previously established with our team. They can relate to specific aspects of your organisation or work in the field (financial management, safety and security, or logistics for example), or to your organisation in general. Request for a quote Personal stories The Red Cross platform in the Indian Ocean is not a training provider. Our core work revolves around disaster response. But we also work on capacity building with the local teams, and for that we clearly need to work with a training provider which has already earned its stripes. What we particularly like with Bioforce is the support and follow-up before, during and after the programme. We have really established a relationship based on trust.
